# Brain-Tumor-Detection
A brain tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue in which cells grow and multiply uncontrollably, bypassing the normal regulatory mechanisms of the body. Brain tumors can be classified into two major types that are Benign Tumors which non-cancerous growths that do not spread to other parts of the brain or body and Malignant Tumors which are cancerous and often aggressive, capable of spreading to other tissues in the brain or spinal cord. Brain tumors can also be primary (originating in the brain) or secondary (metastatic tumors originating from cancers in other parts of the body).
For developing and training the deep learning model , a comprehensive dataset consisting MRI scans of both tumor containing as well as no tumor are collected   and labeled. A Convolution Neural Network model is implemented using Deep Learning and Computer Vision to specify the most suitable approach for accurate Brain Tumor Detection (If it is present or not) and early prediction .

The performance of the Brain Tumor Detection System is assessed based on metrics like ; accuracy, precision, recall, AUC Score and F1-score using cross-validation techniques and also plotting the confusion matrix.

The proposed Brain Tumor Detection System  aims to empower healthcare community like hospitals with a cost-effective and accessible tool for prediction and early detection  of  brain tumors, facilitating timely intervention and private healthcare strategies. By imposing the capabilities of deep learning and computer vision, the system has the capability to revolutionize healthcare practices, decreasing the death rate due to  brain tumors, and hence contributing to healthy and peaceful society.
